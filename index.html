    <h1>Hello, Codeworks Team!</h1>
    <p>My name is Caitlin Brooks. The pace of day one was nice for those of us just starting out. I do need to be better at asking a question the moment I encounter one. Thank you for having an instructor available to assist as one is presenting. A fact about me is every animal I have ever had as a pet has been the color black. Crazy!</p>
